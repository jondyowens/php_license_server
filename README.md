# php_license_server

This PHP server functions as a license management page where a user can connect to the site and view "license keys". Right now it's just connecting a mySQL server on the same box and displaying the rows of a database table in an HTML table.

There is also GET and POST routes that were roughly copied from an example that don't really do anything at the moment.
